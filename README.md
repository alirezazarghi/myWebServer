# myWebServer
myWebServer library for esp8266/nodemcu arduino ide.  

**** 
This project works fine, but wanted to let you know that I have a redesigned version this project: https://github.com/nailbuster/myWebServerAsync

That server uses the Async WEB/TCP library so that it can handle requests quickly and non-blocking. It also includes jquery/bootstrap/css/fontawesome within the library so they are available when booted up.

both projects work,  just depends on your use case, and your preference....
****

Uses Arduino IDE,  ensure latest esp8266 from:  https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino  (make sure you are using staging version, or a release after Jan 2016)

Library requires the use of the following 3rd party libraries to be installed:

TimeLib for ntp here:  https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time

Arduino Json here:  https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson


I'm staring the library as an easy starting/base for working on the esp8266...  myWebServer will serve files from the SPIFFs on your device.  You should only use this on devices with available spiffs!  (4MB on nodemcu for example).

features:  

It will try and connect to your AcessPoint, if not config/connect it will auto-start local AP like "myespxxxx".  You just connect to that AP with your phone/tablet and it will display Wifi connect configuration.  (Uses captive DNS so you can just go to browser and type setup.com or "anything".com).  restart nodemcu after you've configured connection....

Afterwards once device connected to your local router/internet.  You go to it's local lan IP, or if your system supports mDNS you can type http://"device_name".local on your browser(device name is from setup from above).  

Virgin configs will bring up an integrated HTML file browser.  You can upload multiple files or drag files to top to allow you webserver to work...(index.html...etc).

supports OTA updating of ESP device via Wifi.

ntp time support will some methods to easily grab current date/time.

see sample htmls in folder for other features....

this is still a WIP but I'll be updating as needed....I have other features I want to implement as well....

***IF you want to see a sample 'complete' project that uses this server with MQTT & ThingSpeak, see my other project at:  https://github.com/nailbuster/EspressModuleHM
